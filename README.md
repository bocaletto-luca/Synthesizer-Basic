## Key Features

- **Intuitive User Interface:** The application offers an intuitive user interface based on Tkinter, allowing users to easily control the generated sound and envelope parameters.

- **MIDI Management:** Synthesizer LB-1 can receive input from external MIDI devices, enabling users to play the synthesizer using MIDI keyboards or controllers.

- **Sound Control:** Users can adjust the volume, select different waveforms (including sine, triangular, square, and sawtooth), and modify ADSR parameters (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) to shape the desired sound.

- **Real-Time Audio Generation:** The software generates audio signals in real time based on user interactions, allowing them to instantly hear the results of parameter adjustments.

- **MIDI Note to Frequency Conversion:** Synthesizer LB-1 converts MIDI notes into corresponding frequencies, allowing users to play specific notes using standard MIDI input.

- **Compatibility with Various Waveforms:** In addition to standard waveforms like sine waves, the software provides complex waveforms such as sawtooth, square, and triangular for a wide range of sound possibilities.

- **Thread Management:** The application uses threading to handle audio playback so that the user interface remains responsive during sound generation.

Synthesizer Basic is an ideal tool for musicians, composers, and synthesizer enthusiasts who want to experiment with creating unique and personalized sounds. Its intuitive interface and flexible control options make it a powerful instrument for musical exploration and production.
